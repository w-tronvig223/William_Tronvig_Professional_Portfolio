It may be due to the envelope over the structure, causing hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. I\'m comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against our phasers.'

Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? Sections 27, 28 and 29 on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.'
